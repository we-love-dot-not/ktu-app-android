# (Unofficial) KTU AIS APP
Android client for viewing https://uais.cr.ktu.lt/ktuis

# Tech
Kaunas University Of Technology does not have an official open API, so
everything is based on a simple data scrapping.

The app is using [we-love-dot-not/ktu-ais-api-android](https://github.com/we-love-dot-not/ktu-ais-api-android) library.

We moved from Node.js implementation [we-love-dot-not/ktu-ais-api](https://github.com/we-love-dot-not/ktu-ais-api), since it required centralized server for scrapping.
